 <p>Although in many countries women are <strong>achieving equality</strong> in health outcomes and primary school enrollment rates, the world has not seen the same kind of progress when it comes to <em>gender equity</em> in economic opportunity. Women consistently trail men in formal labor force participation, access to credit, savings rates, income levels, entrepreneurship rates, as well as in inheritance and ownership rights.</p>

 <p>Women typically invest in their families and communities significantly more than men – spreading wealth and increasing the quality of life for themselves and their families.PCI has made a commitment to ensure that all of our work includes an explicit focus on gender equality and women’s empowerment.</p>
